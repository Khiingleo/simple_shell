# Simple Shell


## Description

Simple Shell is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) application that provides basic shell functionalities. It supports interactive and non-interactive modes, handles the exit command, and allows execution of commands from the PATH.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

To start the interactive mode, simply run the shell executable:
```bash
$ ./shell
```

You will be presented with a command prompt where you can enter commands. The shell will execute the commands and display the output.

```bash
$ ./shell
shell> ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  directory/
shell> pwd
/home/user
shell> exit
$
```
